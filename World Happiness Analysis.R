## Rich countries are definitely happier than poor countries,â??? he said. â???oItâ???Ts no joy to be poor.â??? But unlike the United States, where a loss of faith in institutions has dovetailed with the drop in happiness reported by Americans, people in Scandinavian countries believe in one another and their governments, Professor Sachs said.In Finland, 91 percent of survey respondents reported being satisfied with their president and 86 percent said they trust the police.
